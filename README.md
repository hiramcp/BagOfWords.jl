# BagOfWords

[![Build Status](https://github.com/donsadit@gmail.com/BagOfWords.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/donsadit@gmail.com/BagOfWords.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml?query=branch%3Amain)


This repository contains experimental text classifiers based on bag of words and linear SVM. The methods found in this repository try to add sophisticated features that give
semantic support and try to solve similar issues found in traditional bag of words approaches.


This is a work in progress...
